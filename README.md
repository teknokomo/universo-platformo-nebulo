Saluton, hello! My name is Vladimir Levadny, I am the General Diverseworker in the International Community Teknokomo and the Chairman of the small people's enterprise Production Cooperative "Soviet Robots". Through the boundless distances of the infinite Universe, through the interference from the energy of the enormous power of the Great Ring system, from a parallel world my words have now reached you and are recorded in this file README.md.

**In this repository, public efforts are currently underway to create Universo Platformo / Universo MMOOMM, in order to launch a global teknokomization and save humanity from final enslavement and complete destruction by creating special mass multi-user virtual worlds, such as Universo MMOOMM, and a platform for their creation - Universo Platformo, initially with gaming functionality, and then with the addition of the Cyberplan functionality.**

More details about all this are written in "[The Book of The Future](https://youtu.be/SqlBGAWyI6I)" and various other materials of ours, most of which are still poorly structured and not in English, but right now work is underway to create new detailed documentation, which will be presented in many languages.

Any, even the most complex idea, if you understand it well, can be described briefly and in simple words. We already understand our idea very well, so here is a short description:

> We are creating Universo MMOOMM, which will initially implement a space MMORPG, like EVE Online and Star Citizen, in which there will be various parallel worlds with different economies, including a more socialist and more capitalist one, then the functionality will be developed in Universo Platformo, in which it will be possible to create various game projects and separate metauniverses, in which digital twins of industries and entire cities will be created, after which, with the help of our robots, this can be transferred to the real world, carrying out a global renovation of the entire world based on our International Plan.

We are developing our own cinematic universe Universo Grandaringo (Great Ring), writing scripts for our own series, creating board games and much more, so we have a very interesting lore, you can find out basic information about it now in this [discussion](https://github.com/teknokomo/universo-platformo-nebulo/issues/11).

Join our work, check out the section "Project developers and project status". All our work is done under the Omsk open license, for more information see the information in the "License" section.

# Inspiration

Our wonderful project, which will help create a global teknokomization and save humanity from final enslavement and total destruction, looks like this in version `0.1.0 Pre-Alpha - 2025-01-12 (Young Bolshevik)`, but we have already done more and better in the new version, join our great victory over the imperialist fascist Satan, help us:

# Where am I and what should I do?

The near future, Omsk is the capital of the world, in the Olympus-1 tower, scientists explain to you that it is possible to connect your consciousness to a robot in another part of the Universe, in a parallel reality, controlled by robots we call Robocubans, through the recently discovered Great Ring system.

A flash, a clouding of consciousness. Gradually, you come to your senses, feeling a new world far from Earth through your robot avatar. Through this robot avatar, you will be able to control your first spaceship, which is made in the cubic style beloved by robots, and conduct various activities in this new world.

Develop the capabilities of your robot avatar and make it more human or a giant robot destroyer. Buy or independently create new spaceships and space stations of completely different classes and styles at shipyards. Extract resources, buy and sell any goods or unique dangerous relics.

Interact with other people from Earth or several alien races and factions. You can join an existing organization, create a new organization or even your own empire. Lead a peaceful life or fight every day. Skill development, many missions, unexpected events - in Universo MMOOMM it is never boring.

Kubio is a parallel world controlled by robots, this is only the central connecting world, from it you can move through the Stargate to other parallel worlds. One gate leads to Konkordo, where the socio-economic interaction is more socialist. The second gate leads to Triumfo, where the socio-economic interaction is mainly capitalist. This economic feature is characteristic of those races that are in the part of space that is closest to the Interworld Stargate in these parallel worlds. The further from these areas of space, the greater the differences in the socio-economic structure.

But this is not only a space multiplayer strategy. Later, you will be able to get to planetary locations and other parts of several parallel worlds, including those described in the metaproject "Omsk - the capital of the world". The development of automation and robotization mechanics of production is planned to be brought to the point of withdrawal from the virtual world to the real one and offer this automation to enterprises and people within the framework of the Cyberplan format, so that digital twins of production and entire cities can be created right in the game, and then, with the help of our robots, transfer all this to the real world.

Well, how do you like it? Do you feel that Universo MMOOMM is the best and most significant project of our time and the near future? Do you want to join us? Soon you will be able to click the "To the Future" button and robots will show you the way. And now the project is in development and you can join our work, support us with your work and financially.

# Tech stack

**This repository is working on implementing Universo Platformo / Universo MMOOMM using PlayCanvas and Tauri.** We assume that Universo MMOOMM will become the largest project implemented on PlayCanvas and will help popularize this wonderful engine. The tech stack will be described in more detail in the near future. This implementation on this tech stack is called "Nebulo" and is currently a priority, as it combines ease of implementation and great capabilities.

Also, since 2018, experiments have been underway to implement Universo Platformo / Universo MMOOMM on various other tech stacks, in particular, we have developments on Godot 3 / Godot 4, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/BbAEiScmxQo) of what it looked like (in Russian).

In the future, it is assumed that Universo Platformo will be implemented as an abstract layer, from which it will be possible to export the platform itself and projects on it implemented on all the most popular engines.

The main work is currently being done on the service https://playcanvas.com. Now experiments with functionality are being conducted in different projects on PlayCanvas, later all our developments will be collected in the Universo MMOOMM project https://playcanvas.com/project/1283218/

This repository on GitHub is the place where we collect our Issues, discussions and documentation, we will save the backup code downloaded from https://playcanvas.com, and we will publish information about our releases. When the PlayCanvas team publishes the open source code of not only their Engine, but also their Editor, they plan to do this in the first quarter of 2025, after which, probably, all our work will be transferred to this repository on GitHub and its clones on other services, such as GitVerse.ru.

# Roadmap

We are working on creating our roadmap, you can suggest your ideas. In short, Stage 0 (pre-project work) was previously implemented, within the framework of which we did a lot of work that allowed us to understand how we can create such a large project with small resources, and we also worked out the lore based on our cinematic universe.

**At the moment, we are planning to implement Stage 1, which implies a single-user non-network MVP, and then Stage 2, which will implement multi-user functionality and communication with the backend.**

We have long had a very large and very complex backend with a lot of functionality, implemented on Django with API GraphQL + OAuth 2.0 server, but we are planning to create an updated backend on a new technology stack, which will be easier to update and maintain. We assume that it could be Strapi CMS + Colyseus, but we continue to study this issue, perhaps this stack will change or other components will be added to it, for example, Supabase.

In MVP, we need to launch the most basic economy. At the beginning, the spaceship is near the station and then flies to the nearest asteroids. Now there will be 2 types of asteroids: stone asteroids and ice asteroids. The ship can extract ore (polymineral) or ice (polycomponent) using an industrial laser. Then the ship takes it to the space station and sells it. Our currency, which will gradually enter the real world, is called Inmo (Internacia mono) - this is "International money" in Esperanto.

In the next steps, at the beginning, the ship will be in the station hangar and can fly out of the station, and then it will be able to fly back to the station hangar when it brings ore. In fact, the economy will be much more complex, including the ability to create very complex production chains, extract more valuable ores using more advanced equipment, etc. Moreover, the action will take place in different parallel worlds, and these worlds will have different economies, capitalist and socialist.

In general, parallel worlds with different economies and options for interaction between these economies are one of the important features of our project, which distinguishes our project from other projects. And this functionality needs to be implemented as quickly as possible. But in the most basic version of MVP, we can implement the simplest economy for demonstration and only one parallel world of robots that help people from our world from the space center in Omsk connect to robot avatars in their world and through these robot avatars interact with spaceships, with each other, and so on.

# Project developers and project status

The project is in active development. The development is carried out by the International Community Teknokomo, including associated organizations such as the People's Enterprise Production Cooperative "Soviet Robots", as well as people and organizations that support the goals and objectives of the project. We call our participants cyberneticists. While we have few game programmers, the main participants are analysts, robot specialists, scriptwriters, designers, testers, and so on, but gradually our forces will increase.

At the moment, the project is being developed mainly by public forces, gradually attracting funding and additional forces / resources to the project through various sources: crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, including through financial subscription, grants, investments that do not break the essence of the project, etc.

Please note that the main part of the project team are socialists / communists / technocommunists and similar views, and we also support traditional family values. Please keep this in mind if you want to participate in this project, it is important that our joint work does not lose its effectiveness, so that we do not get distracted by third-party topics and disputes.

**Join our work! Our motto is: "All worlds will be ours".**
